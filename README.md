# Particle Javascript Materials

I use these materials in my classes to introduce students to work with the Particle.io Javascript API from within simple static HTML web pages.

## Examples that are included

Loggig in with your Particle account to obtain an access token for the API:

* How to [log in insecurely](login_insecure) by putting your Particle username and password in the HTML (DON'T EVER DO THIS!!!)
* How to [log in with a HTML form](login_with_form) so we don't need any usernames or passwords in the HTML

Using your Particle devices:

* How to [list your Particle devices](list_devices) and their IDs
* How to [call a function on a Particle device](call_function) (exercise: add an "off" button to the HTML page)
* How to [get a variable from a Particle device](get_variable)
