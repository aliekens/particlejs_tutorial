# Particle Javascript Materials

I use these materials in my classes to introduce students to work with the Particle.io Javascript API from within simple static HTML web pages.

## Examples that are included

Loggig in with your Particle account:

* How to [log in insecurely](login_insecure) by putting your Particle username and password in the HTML (DON'T EVER DO THIS!!!)
* How to [log in with a HTML form](login_with_form) so we don't need any usernames or passwords in the HTML
