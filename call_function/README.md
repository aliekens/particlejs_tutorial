# Turn an LED on or off over the internet

We'll build a simple web interface to turn an LED on and off on the Particle device.

## How to use

* Flash the [Particle source code](internet_led.ino) to your device
* Use the [Particle console](https://console.particle.io) to check whether functions to turn the LED on or off are exposed
* Change the access token in `call_function.js` to the one you acquired by logging in
* Change the device id in `call_function.js` to the ID of your device
* Open the `index.html` file in your browser
* Open the JavaScript console of your browser
* Use the button in the web page to turn the LED on over the internet

## Exercise

* Extend the web page and Javascript sources so you can turn the LED both on and off with the web page
